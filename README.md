# Inspiration
Fast pace of the modern era has induced a great deal of stress among people, especially amongst Millennials and Generation Z population. While there are apps which provide aid in maintaining with mental and physical health (such as fitness and nutrition app), there are no applications dedicated explicitly to measure and promote happiness and stress level on a regular basis. 
Our idea is to leverage AI to better assess people's happiness level.

# What it does
It allows clients to detect their happiness level on a daily basis based on various channels. Prop measures clients' text interaction on Twitter, Facebook, Instagram, Whatsapp, Gmail, Search History along with music (Spotify) and movie (Netflix) preferences, to come up with a score index that monitors happiness ranging from -1 to 1.

We also provide a chart which the historical index, and thus motivates the clients to strive for better happiness levels.

The score index range breakdown is as below :

# How we built it
We created the webpage through Javascript, React, HTML, and CSS. 
To calculate the sentiment scores for twitter data, we used Google Cloud NLP.


# Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of the prototype that we were able to build within less than 24-hour, particularly in the live twitter API and Javascript for the UI.

# What we learned
Overall it was a great learning experience for us. We discovered things in NLP we previously had not known and learnt totally new concepts such as valence score as they were required for our project to work.

# What's next for Prop
In the future, we hope to develop partnerships with therapists to facilitate therapy appointment suggestions for customers having a constantly low happiness index. We also aim to provide recommendations on what activities can be done if we suspect a decrease in the happiness index. These suggestions can be watching a movie, going to a restaurant, listening to music etc.
